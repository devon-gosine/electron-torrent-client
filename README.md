## 🌈 Why this exists

Modern torrent clients are often **bloated**, **ad-ridden**, or **visually dated**. This project is an attempt to create something better:

🌀 **Electron Torrent Client** is:
- ✨ Aesthetic by default
- 📦 Minimal but full-featured
- 🧘🏽‍♂️ Easy to use, hackable, and vibe-first
- 🧠 Designed for indie devs, creators, and terminal-weary peers

✅ Live download speed and progress  
✅ Automatic streaming of video/audio files  
✅ Cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux)  
✅ Built entirely with web tech  
✅ Super clean UI (more to come)  
✅ Open-source and MIT licensed

## 🧙🏽 Philosophy

This is a **vibe-coded app**. It's meant to:
- Feel satisfying to use
- Be aesthetic without needing themes
- Prioritize clarity and calm over feature creep
- Be a *tool* you *own*, not a product you rent
